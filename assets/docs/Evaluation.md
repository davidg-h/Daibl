# Evaluation README

To assess how effectively our bot responds to TH-specific questions, we conducted an evaluation involving various LLM models, the embedding methods, and the number of documents to be used as context for the questions.

For more information about the evaluation, as well as for the code view the Evaluation folder.

The output of the evaluation shows that we get the best results using the Llama model combined with the TF-IDF algorithm and 5 documents as context.
